# Every DayCalendar - Single Month board - KiCad

A single month habit tracker inspired by [Simone Giertz “The Every Day Calendar”](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar). Allows for tracking of stats for multiple activities throughout the year. On each day, click the buttons for the activities that you have accomplished and the corresponding date on the calendar will illuminate with RGB LEDs.

- Months will progress automatically.
- Several different "modes"
- Physical buttons with leads to be able to expand on the board out to a frame.
- Ability to connect the boards together

Uses a ESP32 to connect to the internet and backup the data from the boards.

Fabricated using JLPCB SMD placement services. Fully automated manufacturing.
